**HR Analysis Project** 

This project uses SQL to analyze a real-world employees database, extract the most useful information from the dataset, pre-process the data using Python for improved performance 
and uses structured query language to retrieve useful information from the database.

It consists of 2 modules __MODULE 1__ and __MODULE 2__

## Module 1

This Module involves working on handling null values, deletion or transformation of irrelevant values, data type transformation, removing duplicates and data validations. 
Objective of this task is to get a refined and cleaner data set for further analysis.

## Module 2
This module involves working on performing data analysis on the pre-processed data from the previous module and conducting Data Analysis using SQL.
Objective of this task is to generate queries for given problem statements. 

The repository consists of Uncleaned dataset, Module 1 that contains cleaned Dataset transformed into a database by me, Module 2 containing SQL queries that I created to analyse data and
