# **HR Analysis Project** #

This project uses SQL to analyze a real-world employees database, extract the most useful information from the dataset, pre-process the data using Python for improved performance 
and uses structured query language to retrieve useful information from the database.

The repository consists of 
- [__Uncleaned Dataset__](https://github.com/Mridul1129261/HR-analysis-project/blob/master/Uncleaned_employees_dataset.csv)
- [__MODULE 1__](https://github.com/Mridul1129261/HR-analysis-project/tree/master/Module%201%20-%20Clean%20data) containing the dataset I cleaned and stored in the form of a database table.
- [__MODULE 2__](https://github.com/Mridul1129261/HR-analysis-project/tree/master/Module%202%20-%20Query%20tasks) containing SQL queries that I created to analyse data

## [Module 1](https://github.com/Mridul1129261/HR-analysis-project/tree/master/Module%201%20-%20Clean%20data)

This Module involves working on handling null values, deletion or transformation of irrelevant values, data type transformation, removing duplicates and data validations. 
Objective of this task is to get a refined and cleaner data set for further analysis.

## [Module 2](https://github.com/Mridul1129261/HR-analysis-project/tree/master/Module%202%20-%20Query%20tasks)
This module involves working on performing data analysis on the pre-processed data from the previous module and conducting Data Analysis using SQL.
Objective of this task is to generate [queries](https://github.com/Mridul1129261/HR-analysis-project/blob/master/Module%202%20-%20Query%20tasks/Tasks.sql) for given problem statements.
